    Simple UIMask shader by luluco250

    I have no idea why this was never ported back to ReShade 3.0 from 2.0,
    but if you missed it, here it is.

    It doesn't feature the auto mask from the original shader.
    
    It does feature a new multi-channnel masking feature. UI masks can now contain
    separate 'modes' within each of the three color channels.
    
    For example, you can have the regular hud on the red channel (the default one),
    a mask for an inventory screen on the green channel and a mask for a quest menu
    on the blue channel. You can then use keyboard keys to toggle each channel on or off.
    
    Multiple channels can be active at once, they'll just add up to mask the image.
    
    Simple/legacy masks are not affected by this, they'll work just as you'd expect,
    so you can still make simple black and white masks that use all color channels, it'll
    be no different than just having it on a single channel.

    Tips:
    
    --You can adjust how much it will affect your HUD by changing "Mask Intensity".
    
    --You don't actually need to place the UIMask_Bottom technique at the bottom of
      your shader pipeline, if you have any effects that don't necessarily affect 
      the visibility of the HUD you can place it before that.
      For instance, if you use color correction shaders like LUT, you might want
      to place UIMask_Bottom just before that.

    --Preprocessor flags:
      --UIMASK_MULTICHANNEL:
        Enables having up to three different masks on each color channel.
      --UIMASK_TOGGLEKEY_RED:
        Keycode that toggles the red channel of the mask.
      --UIMASK_TOGGLEKEY_BLUE:
        Keycode that toggles the blue channel of the mask.
      --UIMASK_TOGGLEKEY_GREEN:
        Keycode that toggles the green channel of the mask.
      
    --Refer to this page for keycodes: 
      https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731(v=vs.85).aspx

    --To make a custom mask:

      1-Take a screenshot of your game with the HUD enabled,
       preferrably with any effects disabled for maximum visibility.

      2-Open the screenshot with your preferred image editor program, I use GIMP.

      3-Make a background white layer if there isn't one already.
        Be sure to leave it behind your actual screenshot for the while.

      4-Make an empty layer for the mask itself, you can call it "mask".

      5-Having selected the mask layer, paint the places where HUD constantly is,
        such as health bars, important messages, minimaps etc.
      
      6-Delete or make your screenshot layer invisible.

      7-Before saving your mask, let's do some gaussian blurring to improve it's look and feel:
        For every step of blurring you want to do, make a new layer, such as:
        Mask - Blur16x16
        Mask - Blur8x8
        Mask - Blur4x4
        Mask - Blur2x2
        Mask - NoBlur
        You should use your image editor's default gaussian blurring filter, if there is one.
        This avoids possible artifacts and makes the mask blend more easily on the eyes.
        You may not need this if your mask is accurate enough and/or the HUD is simple enough.

      8-Now save the final image as "UIMask.png" in your textures folder and you're done!
